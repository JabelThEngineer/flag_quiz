## Challenges
The most challenging part was working with JavaScript. Although I knew the basics, it was my first time using functions like `addEventListener()` or `setTimeout()`, so
it took me a while to understand how to use them properly.
I got help from ChatGPT to make everything work correctly, but I learned a lot about using JS for interactive features.
This is my first 'full' project made with HTML, CSS and JS.
